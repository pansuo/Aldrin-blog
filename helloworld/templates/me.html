				Hey, my name is Aldrin Agana. I'm a third year computer science major at UC Davis. I began my college career as an Applied Mathematics major but later switched to computer science after taking my first C class. I love to program and I'm a quick learner. Iâ€™ve taught myself Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery, and I just started working on this personal website of mine to showcase my skills.
