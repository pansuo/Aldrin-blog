Hello World! <br>
I began learning html through Udacity. This is my scribble sheet. <br>
<em>This line is italicized using the "em" tag</em> <br>
<b>This line is bold using the "b" tag</b> <br>
<div>This line is a part of a new section using the "div" tag. Div is a block.</div> <br>
<span>This line is wrapped in span. Span is inline</span> <br>
<strong>These words are big using the "strong" tag</strong> <br>
<a href="http://reddit.com"> Here's a link to reddit with the "a" tag</a> <br>
<p>These words are in a new paragraph because it is wrapped with the "p" tag which is the
    paragraph tag
</p>

<div>URLs can have query parameters that are separated from the path using a "?". Multiple parameters
    are separated by an ampersand.
</div>
<div>Fragments come after the parameters and are separated by a #. They're meant for javascript and other
    complex stuff that I don't know. They ARENT sent to the server, only query parameters are.
</div>
<p>HTTP requests are formatted like this: GET /path?p=1 HTTP/1.1
    Headers: <br>
    header-name: header-data
</p>
<p>HTTP responses are formatted like this: HTTP/1.1 STATUSCODE OK. 200 - ok, 302 - found, 404 - not found
    </p>
